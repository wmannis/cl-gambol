                  Gambol - a slighly modified Frolic


The GAMBOL package is a trivially modified extraction of the logic
programming portion of the Frolic system written at the University of
Utah.  I have made a few changes to get it to compile under a modern
Common Lisp, in addition to a few style changes that don't alter any
functionality. 

For documentation, examples and a full list of the changes I've made
to turn Frolic into Gambol, please see the software web site,
