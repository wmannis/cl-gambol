                  Gambol - a slighly modified Frolic


The GAMBOL package is a trivially modified extraction of the logic
programming portion of the Frolic system written at the University of
Utah.  I have made a few changes to get it to compile under a modern
Common Lisp, in addition to a few style changes that don't alter any
functionality.  In the original code macros are used freely where
inline functions might do better.  I have separated from it all
references to Frobs.

The first big change to the original is that logic variables start
with the more traditional question mark, ?WHO, rather than the leading
underscore of the original, _WHO.

The second large change is that I removed the ^ and ^^ read macros and
replaced them with what look like predicates, LISP and LISP-ALWAYS.  I
don't like monkeying with the read-table without a very good reason,
and this trivial sugaring seemed excessive.
