    Gambol operator tests instead of EQ*, which is picky about packages
  * made FAIL part of SEARCH-RULES, so you can't accidentally make it
    a true fact
  * added PL-RETRACT, and associated helpers
  * added PL-ASSERTA to insert new rules in the database at the
    beginning of the list for the functor
