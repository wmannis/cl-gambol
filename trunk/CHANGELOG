0.03 - some date
  * removed a magic incantation required to get around a PSL bug of
    all things  
  * added functions and macros to support multiple rulebases:
    MAKE-RULEBASE, CURRENT-RULEBASE, WITH-RULEBASE
  * minor style tweakery

0.02 - July 10 2008
  * clean-up of the package exports, by way of using STRING= on the
    Gambol operator tests instead of EQ*, which is picky about packages
  * made FAIL part of SEARCH-RULES, so you can't accidentally make it
    a true fact
  * added PL-RETRACT, and associated helpers
  * added PL-ASSERTA to insert new rules in the database at the
    beginning of the list for the functor
  * added more operations to gambol, to match the new functions,
    asserta, assertz (like their Prolog counterparts) and retract

0.01 - July 3 2008
  * initial release
