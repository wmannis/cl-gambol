                  Gambol - a slighly modified Frolic


The GAMBOL package is a trivially modified extraction of the logic
programming portion of the Frolic system written at the University of
Utah.  I have made a few changes to get it to compile under a modern
Common Lisp, in addition to a few style changes that don't alter any
functionality.  I have separated from it all references to Frobs.  In
the original code macros are used freely where inline functions might
do better.  This made tracing difficult so some macros have been
turned into functions.

The first big change to the original is that logic variables start
with the more traditional question mark, ?WHO, rather than the leading
underscore of the original, _WHO.

The second large change is that I removed the ^ and ^^ read macros and
replaced them with what look like predicates, LOP (Lisp OPerator) and
LISP.  I don't like monkeying with the read-table without a very good
reason, and this trivial sugaring seemed excessive.
