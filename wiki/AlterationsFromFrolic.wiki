#summary what I changed to turn Frolic into Gambol

 * Logical variables were converted from `_var` to `?var` (a more common representation).
 * The `^` read macro was yanked, and replaced with predicate operators, `LOP` and `LISP`.
 * References to 'frobs' removed.
 * The operation of `LOP` and `LISP` was switched from using `EVAL` to using `APPLY`.  This somewhat restricts how these can be used, but I don't think that's really a problem.
 * The "I don't care" variable is `??` instead of `__`.  I might yet change this to just `?` which is somewhat common.
 * Several unused global variables were removed, including the state storage which would have allowed the `HOW` function to explain how a solution was reached.  It looks like that was never completed.
 * The code exhibits a preoccupation with performance, which often takes the form of macros where functions would do just as well.  You can't trace macros, so I converted some of these back to normal functions.
 * I added a macro to iterate over solutions from `PL-SOLVE-ALL`, `DO-SOLVE-ALL`.
